A checksum is computed by adding all the bytes transmitted or recieved so far.
Checksums are always 8 bits long, so the checksum should be computed mod 256.
(Ie, take the last 8 bits of the result)


Command: Ping
Description: Test communication with sensor board
Send:  [0x00 0x00]
Reply: [0xBC] (Success)



Command: System Check
Description: Ask sensor board to verify operation of all its processors.
Send:  [0x01 0x01]
Reply: [0xBC] (Success)
       [0xDF] (Failure)



Command: Get Depth
Description: Retrieve the latest depth value.
Send:  [0x02 0x02]
Reply: [0x03 MSB LSB Checksum] (Success)
       [0xDF] (Failure)



Command: Get water, power board, and start switch status
Description: Retrieve a 1-byte status of various pins.
Send:  [0x04 0x04]
Reply: [0x05 Status Checksum] (Success)
       [0xDF] (Failure)

       Status Bit 0    = Water (0=Dry, 1=Wet)
       Status Bit 1    = Start Switch (0=Off, 1=On)
       Status Bits 1-4 = Balancer board status lines



Command: Hard power kill
Description: Ask balancer board to cut off all power.
Send:  [0x06 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF 0x3E]

       [0xDF] (Command malformed)

The command sequence is deliberately long and complex to prevent accidental activation.
After issuing this command, the host should still perform various shut-down tasks, in the
event that the hard kill command fails. 0xDF is returned if the command was NOT performed
because a part of the 'safety sequence' was not recieved properly. A reply of 0xBC means
that the command was received successfully, but if the host is still alive to receive this
reply, it means that the hard kill obviously failed and other measures must be taken.
