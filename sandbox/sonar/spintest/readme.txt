Mike Levashov and Leo Singer collecting 
data.

500 ksps, pinger set for 20 kHz sine 
wave, burst of 42 cycles sent every 1 
second.

Pinger is suspended about four meters 
from the side of the tank, a meter or 
so underwater.

Hydrophones are suspended from crane, 
in the approximate center of the tank, 
1.5 meters or so underwater.  A 
"T" made of PVC is stuck through the 
hook of the crane.  To the leg of the 
"T" is tied a rope that goes to the 
deck, and is used as a lever arm to 
rotate the hydrohpone array.

The 19 posts that support the railings 
around the tank are used as anchor points
for the rope.  We anchored the rope to each
post in succession, taking samples from the
Blackfin at each post.

The post closest to the control room doors
is post "00", and the rest are labeled "01"
through "18" counterclockwise.

We took data going counterclockwise at posts 
0 through 12, then noticed that the hydrophone 
cable was twisting and so went all the way to 
post 18, and proceeded clockwise from 18 back
through 13.

Datasets are labeled "rxx.bin" where the "xx"
goes from 00 through 18.

As a sanity check, we also repeated the measurements
at posts 12 down through 10, labeling them
"rxx_cw.bin" to denote the fact that they
are duplicates, taken clockwise opposed
to the original counterclockwise ordering.
