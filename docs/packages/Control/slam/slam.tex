This document is intended to allow a motivated student to understand the basics about how control strategies can be applied for depth control of an AUV.  This document is \emph{not} intended to be a suitable replacement for a classical course in control theory.  Without a thorough understanding of the underlying mathematics and concepts that are glossed over or skipped entirely in this paper, it can be dangerous for a novice to implement these strategies.  When in doubt, seek consultation or supervision from someone experienced.
