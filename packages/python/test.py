def Mock(bases=(), *initargs, **kw):
    """
    Simple factory for dummy classes that can be used as replacement for the 
    real implementation in tests.
    
    Base classes for the mock can be specified using the first parameter, which
    must be either a tuple of class objects or a single class object. If the
    bases parameter is omitted, the base class of the mock will be object.

    So to create a mock that is derived from the builtin dict type, you can do:

    >>> mock = Mock(dict)
    >>> mock['foo'] = 'bar'
    >>> mock['foo']
    'bar'

    Attributes of the class are provided by any additional keyword parameters.

    >>> mock = Mock(foo='bar')
    >>> mock.foo
    'bar'

    Objects produces by this function have the special feature of not requiring
    the 'self' parameter on methods, because you should keep data at the scope
    of the test function. So you can just do:

    >>> mock = Mock(add=lambda x,y: x+y)
    >>> mock.add(1, 1)
    2

    To access attributes from the mock object from inside a lambda function,
    just access the mock itself:

    >>> mock = Mock(dict, do=lambda x: 'going to the %s' % mock[x])
    >>> mock['foo'] = 'bar'
    >>> mock.do('foo')
    'going to the bar'

    Because assignments or other types of statements don't work in lambda
    functions, assigning to a local variable from a mock function requires some
    extra work:

    >>> myvar = [None]
    >>> mock = Mock(set=lambda x: myvar.__setitem__(0, x))
    >>> mock.set(1)
    >>> myvar[0]
    1

    if not isinstance(bases, tuple):
        bases = (bases,)
    cls = type('Mock', bases, {})

    for k,v in kw.items():
        setattr(mock, k, v)
