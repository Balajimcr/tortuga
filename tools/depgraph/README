This is tool that uses from a few small python modules found on the internet.
It generates a graph which show interdependencies between python modules. It
creates a dot which can be run through the 'dot' tool to generate images.

Options:
  --mono(-m)   -   Sets the ouput to be black and white
  --ouput(-o)  -   Sets the dot file to writen to the given file instead of stdout

Example:

This runs the tool on the simulator tool and genertes then pipe the output to
do which turns it into depgraph.png.
  python gengraph.py ../simulator/app.py | dot -T png -o depgraph.png

This Example stores the graph in a file first then generates the image.
  python gengraph.py ../simulator/app.py -o depgraph.dot
  dot depgraph.dot -T png -o depgraph.png
